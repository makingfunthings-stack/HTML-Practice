    <h1>World's Best Biryani</h1>
    <p>Mutton biryani is a fragrant South Asian rice dish made by layering spiced, slow-cooked mutton with long-grain basmati rice, fresh herbs, and whole spices. Cooked on low heat so the flavors meld together, it’s rich, aromatic, and often served with raita or salad.</p>
